SELECT COUNT(*) as total_sales FROM ['SQL - Retail Sales Analysis_utf$'];
```

### Unique Customers
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as total_customers FROM ['SQL - Retail Sales Analysis_utf$'];
```

### Unique Categories
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM ['SQL - Retail Sales Analysis_utf$'];
```

## 📊 Key Business Questions & SQL Solutions

### Q1: Retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05'
```sql
SELECT * FROM ['SQL - Retail Sales Analysis_utf$']
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```

### Q2: Transactions where category = 'Clothing' and quantity sold > 4
```sql
SELECT * FROM ['SQL - Retail Sales Analysis_utf$']
WHERE category = 'Clothing' AND quantity >= 4;
```

### Q3: Calculate total sales (total_sale) for each category
```sql
SELECT category, SUM(total_sale) AS net_sale, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM ['SQL - Retail Sales Analysis_utf$']
GROUP BY category;
```

### Q4: Average age of customers in 'Beauty' category
```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(age), 3) AS Avg_age
FROM ['SQL - Retail Sales Analysis_utf$']
WHERE category = 'Beauty';
```

### Q5: Transactions where total_sale > 1000
```sql
SELECT * FROM ['SQL - Retail Sales Analysis_utf$']
WHERE total_sale > 1000;
```

### Q6: Number of transactions by gender and category
```sql
SELECT category, gender, COUNT(*) AS total_trans
FROM ['SQL - Retail Sales Analysis_utf$']
GROUP BY category, gender;
```

### Q7: Average monthly sales and best-selling months
```sql
SELECT YEAR(sale_date) AS year, MONTH(sale_date) AS month, AVG(total_sale) AS avg_total_sale
FROM ['SQL - Retail Sales Analysis_utf$']
GROUP BY YEAR(sale_date), MONTH(sale_date)
ORDER BY YEAR(sale_date), avg_total_sale DESC;
```

### Q8: Top 5 customers by total sales
```sql
SELECT TOP 5 customer_id, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sale
FROM ['SQL - Retail Sales Analysis_utf$']
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_sale DESC;
```

### Q9: Unique customers by category
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers, category
FROM ['SQL - Retail Sales Analysis_utf$']
GROUP BY category;
```
