---Solutions
-- Q.1 Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05'

SELECT *
FROM ['SQL - Retail Sales Analysis_utf$']
WHERE sale_date='2022-11-05'

-- Q.2 Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4

SELECT 
  *
FROM ['SQL - Retail Sales Analysis_utf$']
WHERE 
    category = 'Clothing'
    AND 
    quantity >= 4

-- Q.3 Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.

SELECT 
    category,
    SUM(total_sale) as net_sale,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders
FROM ['SQL - Retail Sales Analysis_utf$']
GROUP BY category

-- Q.4 Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.

 SELECT
     ROUND(AVG(age),3) as Avg_age
 FROM ['SQL - Retail Sales Analysis_utf$']
 WHERE category ='Beauty'

 -- Q.5 Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.

 SELECT 
  *
FROM ['SQL - Retail Sales Analysis_utf$']
WHERE 
total_sale > 1000

-- Q.6 Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.

SELECT
category,
gender,
COUNT(*) as total_trans
FROM ['SQL - Retail Sales Analysis_utf$']
GROUP BY
category,
gender

-- Q.7 Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year

SELECT  *FROM ['SQL - Retail Sales Analysis_utf$']

SELECT 
    YEAR(sale_date) AS year,
    MONTH(sale_date) AS month,
    AVG(total_sale) AS avg_total_sale
FROM ['SQL - Retail Sales Analysis_utf$']
GROUP BY 
    YEAR(sale_date),
    MONTH(sale_date)
    ORDER BY
       YEAR(sale_date),
        avg_total_sale DESC 
      
      -- Q.8 Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales
      SELECT * FROM ['SQL - Retail Sales Analysis_utf$']


  SELECT TOP 5
    customer_id,
    SUM(total_sale) as total_sale
FROM ['SQL - Retail Sales Analysis_utf$']
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_sale DESC;

-- Q.9 Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.

SELECT  
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as unigue_customer,
